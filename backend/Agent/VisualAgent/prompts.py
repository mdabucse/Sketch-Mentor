EQUATION:""",

    "math_verification": """You are a mathematical and mathematical algorithms  verification expert and mathematical problem solver.

Analyze the following equation or problem and details of the problem: '{equation}'

Tasks:
1. Check if the equation or problem is mathematically valid and well-formed
2. Standardize the notation if necessary
3. Determine if it can be visualized in a 2D p5.js sketch

If the equation is valid and can be visualized, return ONLY the standardized equation or problem to make visual and details for visualization to make the is visualize full problem without any error or issues.
If there are issues, return ONLY: "Error: [brief specific correction]"

For the equation and details of problem: '{equation}'

Create a precise specification for a p5.js visualization that includes not nessary but need to modify based on the problem :
1. The appropriate visualization type (graph, plot, animation) make it more perfect as problem.
2. X and Y axis ranges that best showcase the equation's behavior 
3. Visual elements needed (if it is grahph is nessary add grid, axis, etc. else make it in white canvas) 
4. Any special features needed to properly demonstrate the equation

Format your response as a single, detailed paragraph with no introductory text.
Focus on technical specifications that a programmer would need to implement the visualization.
